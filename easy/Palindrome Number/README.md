## Palindrome Number

### Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

| Example 1   | Example 2    | Example 3  |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:----------:|
| Input: 123  | Input: -121  | Input: 10 |
| Output: true | Output: false | Output: false |

***
#### Explanations:

* Example 2: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
* Example 3: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
