## Two Sum

### Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

| Example 1   | Example 2    | Example 3  |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:----------:|
| Input: 123  | Input: -123  | Input: 120 |
| Output: 321 | Output: -321 | Output: 21 |

* Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
